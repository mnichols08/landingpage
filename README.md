# landingpage
Im trying to build a skincare product landing page. 
My inspiration is the IPSY landing page, but I can't quite figure out how to make the menu show up above the line. 
I also am trying to make all the price options show up in three boxes aligned side by side. 
I am having a lot of trouble with that.
